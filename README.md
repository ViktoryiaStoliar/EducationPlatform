The frontend of EducationPlatform is built using the following technologies:

React: The project utilizes the React library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

Material UI: Material UI is employed to create a visually appealing and responsive design, ensuring a consistent and modern look for the platform.

react-router-dom: React Router DOM is used for implementing efficient client-side routing, enabling smooth navigation between different sections of the platform.

Backend Technologies
The backend of EducationPlatform is developed using the following technologies:
•	TypeScript: TypeScript is chosen to enhance code maintainability and catch potential errors during development.
•	Express: The Express framework is used to build the backend server, providing a robust foundation for handling API requests and business logic.
•	Nodemon: Nodemon ensures automatic server restarts during development, enabling a streamlined development process.
•	CORS: CORS middleware is employed to handle cross-origin resource sharing, allowing the frontend to make requests to the backend from different domains.
•	JWT (JSON Web Tokens): JWT is used for implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring that users can access appropriate resources based on their roles.
•	bcrypt: The bcrypt library is used for hashing user passwords, enhancing security by storing passwords securely in the database.
•	Jest: Jest is utilized for writing and running unit tests, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the backend codebase.
•	pg: The pg library provides a connection to a PostgreSQL database, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of data.
•	Supertest: Supertest is used alongside Jest for writing API integration tests, ensuring the smooth functioning of API endpoints.
